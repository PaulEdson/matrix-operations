Matrix manager structure:
-matrix.py contains the matrix class which wraps matrices within objects
-any matrix operation that returns a matrix returns it as a matrix object
-unit tests contained within unitTests.py
-unit tests are separated between two classes, one for userCalculator.py, one for matrix.py
-userCalculator import matrix class and uses its methods to perform all matrix functions.

Running the code:
-To run this code, run the userCalculator.py script. 
-matplotlib and seaborn must be installed for the userCalculator.py script to run

Using the app:
-after running the code, you will be asked to enter a matrix
-type "help" for a list of all commands
-matrices can be entered as 2d lists in the command line or as a text file in the same format eg. [[1,2,3],[1,4,5],[5,5,5]] or matrixFile.txt
-if entered as a file, run the command from the directory the file is in, or provide the path
-saved matrices are stored in a file called savedMatrix.txt in the directory you run the program from

list of available commands:
-matrix generation commands:
    -"random" - generates a matrix given shape and populates it with random integers between 1-10 
        -example command: random:3 3
    
    -"identity" - generates an identity matrix given a size
        -example command: identity:7
    
-Matrix manipulation commands:
*after inputing a matrix, you will be asked if you want to perform any operations. Any of the following can be run
    - "+" - add a matrix to the existing matrix. Will prompt for another matrix to be entered
    - "-" - subtract a matrix from the existing matrix. Will prompt for another matrix.
    - "*" - multiply matrix by another matrix. Will prompt for another matrix. 
    - "transpose" - transpose the current matrix and set the transposed matrix as the new current matrix
    - "inverse" - inverse the current matrix and set the inverted matrix as the new current matrix
    - "determinant" - display the determinant of the current matrix. Does not change current matrix
    - "eigDecomp" - display the three matrices that make up the eigen decomposition of the current matrix. Does not change current matrix
    - "display" - displays current matrix as a seaborn heatmap 
    - "clear" - clear the current matrix. The program will prompt for a new one.
    - "exit" - exit from the program
